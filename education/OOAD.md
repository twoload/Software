  Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Modularization
  --------------------- class ---------------------------
  --------------------- object --------------------------
  ```
* LSP
* Object : Entity with Unique Identity
* Real world ---(Abstraction)---> Software
* Object Oriented : Objects which have their own advantage solve the problems by collaborating with messages
* DDD (Domain Driven Design)
* ``` 
  DDD (Entity) = OO (Object)
  DDD (Value Object) = OO (Attribute)
  ```
* Object -> mutable (possible to update)
* Attribute -> immutable
* Service / Responsibility
* states = current value of each of the attributes (dynamic)
* Attribute = property
* client only depends interface
  * implementation changes often
* message = request for action
* receiver
* ```
  Interface (visible)
  -------------------
  Implementation (hidden)
  ```
